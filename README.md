# Snake
Classic CLI snake game developed based on Linux/macOS systems, yet it supports Windows. <br>
<br>
Helpful repository contains conio.h library adaptation for Linux/macOS systems: https://github.com/zoelabbb/conio.h. You can place the header file conio.h inside the GCC includes directory (#include <conio.h>), or keep the file conio.h in the same location where the source code will be compiled. (#include "conio.h") <br>
